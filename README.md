# Gimkit-Learn-Bot
A Bot that plays and learns the educational game Gimkit.


Intructions: 

Go to: https://repl.it/@CollinLinde/Gimkit-Bot#gimkit.py
Then hit Run and put in the info.

If you want to see what the bot is doing, comment out the following line in gimkit.py :
options.add_argument("--headless")

so put a # in front of it ;) P.S it is really glitchy and probobaly won't even work so I would recomend leaving it in there!


Or you can just download the files and skip the whole repl.it thing.
